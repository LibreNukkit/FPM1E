# Nukkit PM1E but OPEN SOURCE

PetteriM1 has violated the GPL 3.0+ license, so I decided to make this codebase.

This version is based on a near-release of the original PM1E.

deobfuscated and try to provide a codebase for development.

You should fix CraftingData loading so you can use it to join.

It currently compiles.
